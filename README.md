# Cloudflare Booth Puzzle - Durable Objects Edition

An interactive conference booth puzzle game built with Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects. This is an enhanced version of the [original KV-based implementation](https://github.com/mcdays94/cloudflare-booth-puzzle), migrated to use Durable Objects for improved consistency, performance, and reliability.

## ðŸŽ¯ About This Project

This application creates engaging puzzle games for cybersecurity conference booths, featuring:
- **Interactive puzzle displays** with QR codes for mobile access
- **Real-time submission tracking** with correctness validation  
- **Animated spinning winner wheel** for raffle selection
- **Multi-conference support** with complete data isolation
- **Professional admin interface** for conference management

**Original Project**: [cloudflare-booth-puzzle](https://github.com/mcdays94/cloudflare-booth-puzzle) (KV-based version)

## ðŸ¤– AI-Assisted Development Disclaimer

This project was developed with significant assistance from AI coding tools (Cascade/Claude). The AI contributed to:
- Architecture design and Durable Objects migration strategy
- Code implementation and debugging
- Documentation generation (including this README)
- Multi-regional test data creation
- UI/UX improvements and responsive design

While the core logic, requirements, and testing were human-driven, the AI played a substantial role in the technical implementation and documentation.

## What Changed
- **KV -> Durable Objects**: Replaced `PUZZLE_KV` with two Durable Objects:
  - **`RegistryDO`**: Tracks the list of conference IDs and names.
  - **`ConferenceDO`**: One instance per conference (using `idFromName(conferenceId)`), storing:
    - `conference` object (id, name, puzzle, active, created, winner/ended/reopened)
    - `submission:*` entries
    - `display-mode` state (puzzle/winner/ended)
- **Routes unchanged**: All `/api/*` and pages (`/puzzle`, `/submit`, `/winner`, `/admin`) behave as before, now delegating to DOs.

## Files
- `src/worker.js`: Worker entry with DO classes, route handlers, and HTML rendering.
- `wrangler.toml`: Durable Objects bindings and migration tag.
- `package.json`: Dev/deploy scripts.

## Setup
1. Install Wrangler and login
   ```bash
   npm i -g wrangler
   wrangler login
   ```
2. Configure secrets (sensitive data)
   ```bash
   # Turnstile keys for CAPTCHA verification
   wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY
   wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY
   
   # Cloudflare Access service token for admin S2S calls
   wrangler secret put CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID
   wrangler secret put CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET
   ```
3. Set up custom domain
   - Configure DNS for `puzzledo.lusostreams.com` to point to your Cloudflare zone
   - The route is configured in `wrangler.toml`
4. Dev
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Deploy
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Data Model (Durable Objects)
- `RegistryDO` keys
  - `conf:<id>` -> `name`
- `ConferenceDO` keys
  - `conference` -> conference object
  - `submission:<uuid>` -> submission object
  - `display-mode` -> string (puzzle | winner | ended)

## Migration Notes
- Creating a new conference now:
  - Instantiates/initializes its `ConferenceDO` via `/create`
  - Adds to `RegistryDO`
- Reshuffle clears submissions within the same DO.
- Submission count and listing are per-DO list operations.

## Compatibility
- Public/admin APIs preserved, so the original admin UI should work.
- Uses `puzzledo.lusostreams.com` to avoid conflicts with your existing `puzzle.lusostreams.com` deployment.
- Environment variables moved to secrets for better security.

## Security
- Turnstile verification is preserved.
- Admin endpoints that used Access headers continue to work as before.
